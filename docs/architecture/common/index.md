## Usage

These documents can be:
- Referenced from project-specific architecture documents
- Copied and adapted for new projects
- Used as templates for similar architecture patterns
- Maintained independently from project-specific documentation

## Note

While these patterns are reusable, they may contain project-specific examples. When reusing, adapt the content to your specific project context.
