# Introduction

This document outlines the complete frontend architecture for Time-Tracking Kanban App for Solo Freelancers. This is a local-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) that operates entirely in the browser with no backend services. All data processing and storage happens client-side using IndexedDB, and the application works offline-first. This architecture document serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the technology stack.

The application follows a component-based React architecture with local data persistence, Service Worker infrastructure for offline capabilities, and a focus on desktop-optimized user experience.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

This is a new project starting from scratch. No existing starter templates or codebases are being used. The application will be built as a React-based Progressive Web App (PWA) using Vite as the build tool.
