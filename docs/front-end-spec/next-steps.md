# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Stakeholder Review**
   - Review this UI/UX specification with product team and stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on design principles, user flows, and component specifications
   - Validate assumptions about user needs and interaction patterns
   - Confirm alignment with project goals and constraints

2. **Design Tool Setup**
   - Select design tool (Figma recommended for collaboration)
   - Set up design file structure and component library
   - Create design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) based on style guide
   - Establish design handoff process and documentation standards

3. **Create Visual Designs**
   - Design high-fidelity mockups for Dashboard/Kanban Board (primary interface)
   - Design Task Detail Modal with all states and interactions
   - Design Task Creation Form (both inline and modal variants)
   - Create component library with all variants and states
   - Design empty states, error states, and loading states

4. **Design System Implementation**
   - Create design system documentation in design tool
   - Document all components with specifications (sizes, spacing, colors)
   - Create interactive prototypes for key user flows
   - Test prototypes with potential users for feedback

5. **Accessibility Audit Preparation**
   - Review accessibility requirements with design and development teams
   - Set up accessibility testing tools and processes
   - Create accessibility checklist for design review
   - Plan for user testing with users who have disabilities

6. **Handoff to Development**
   - Prepare design specifications for frontend developers
   - Export assets (icons, images) in appropriate formats
   - Provide CSS/styling values and design tokens
   - Document interaction states and animation specifications
   - Schedule design review sessions with development team

- [ ] Performance goals established and design optimized
- [ ] Design tokens exported (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] Assets exported in appropriate formats (SVG for icons, optimized images)
- [ ] Interactive prototypes created for key flows
- [ ] Design specifications documented for developers
- [ ] Animation specifications provided with timing and easing
- [ ] Accessibility annotations added to designs
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints documented with layout changes
- [ ] Design review completed with stakeholders
- [ ] Developer handoff meeting scheduled

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Design Tool Selection**
   - Confirm design tool choice (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or other)
   - Establish collaboration workflow and version control

2. **Icon Library**
   - Select icon library (Heroicons, Lucide, custom SVG set, or other)
   - Ensure icon style consistency with brand identity

3. **Custom Font Consideration**
   - Decide if custom font is needed or if system fonts are sufficient
   - If custom font: Select font family, consider loading performance

4. **Dark Mode Implementation**
   - Finalize dark mode color palette and design specifications
   - Determine if dark mode is MVP or post-MVP feature

5. **Mobile Support Timeline**
   - Confirm if mobile support is truly out of scope for MVP
   - If post-MVP: Plan mobile design approach and timeline

6. **Animation Library**
   - Decide on animation approach (CSS transitions, animation library, or custom)
   - Consider performance implications and browser support

7. **Design Review Process**
   - Establish design review workflow and approval process
   - Define feedback collection and iteration process
   - Schedule regular design sync meetings with development team

## Future Enhancements

**Post-MVP Considerations:**
- Mobile app design and responsive mobile experience
- Advanced revenue dashboard with charts and analytics
- Customizable board columns and workflows
- Multiple board support
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Task templates and recurring tasks
- Enhanced reporting and export features
- Integration with external tools (calendar, invoicing)

**Design System Evolution:**
- Expand component library as features are added
- Refine design tokens based on usage and feedback
- Create design system documentation site
- Establish design system governance and contribution process
