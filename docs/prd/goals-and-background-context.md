# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable solo freelancers to accurately track billable hours and increase revenue through integrated time tracking
- Reduce context switching and administrative overhead by combining task management with time tracking in a single workflow
- Provide freelancer-specific features (billable hours, client context, revenue tracking) without requiring paid customization tiers
- Deliver a desktop-first kanban experience optimized for solo freelancer workflows
- Increase productivity through streamlined task and time management

## Background Context

Solo freelancers currently struggle with fragmented workflows, using generic tools like Asana and Trello that weren't designed for their specific needs. These tools require paid tiers for customization and keep time tracking separate from task management, creating friction that reduces productivity and leads to lost billable hours. The current landscape lacks an affordable, freelancer-focused solution that combines kanban task visualization with integrated time tracking.

This PRD addresses the core problem: freelancers need a single tool that understands their workflow—managing multiple clients and projects simultaneously, distinguishing billable from non-billable work, and providing visibility into revenue potential. By combining kanban task management with built-in time tracking, we eliminate context switching and administrative overhead while ensuring accurate capture of billable hours.
