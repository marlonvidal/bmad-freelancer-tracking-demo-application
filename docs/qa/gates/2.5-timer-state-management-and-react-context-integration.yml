nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Timer state validation prevents invalid operations. Task existence validation prevents starting timers for deleted tasks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance optimizations: useMemo for context value, React.memo for TaskCard, debouncing for rapid operations, throttled elapsed time updates (1s), optimized IndexedDB writes (30s periodic saves). Manual performance profiling recommended (Task 16)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks, state validation, corrupted state recovery, task deletion handling, IndexedDB error handling. Edge cases well covered: rapid start/stop, browser refresh, invalid state."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code follows established TaskContext/ColumnContext patterns. Well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Good TypeScript typing. JSDoc documentation present. useTaskWithTimer hook provides clean integration pattern."
