top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "14 test failures across ProjectSelector, ProjectContext, and integration tests - primarily async timing issues, element selection problems, and test setup issues"

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Test selectors need improvement - multiple elements with same text causing ambiguous queries"
    suggested_action: "Use more specific test IDs or data-testid attributes, prefer getByRole/getByLabelText with more specific queries"
