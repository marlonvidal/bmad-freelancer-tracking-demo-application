  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "XSS protection properly implemented via HTML escaping in searchUtils.tsx. Input validation handles special characters safely. No security concerns identified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimizations implemented and tested: debouncing (300ms), useMemo for filtered calculations, Set-based tag lookups (O(1)), early returns for empty queries. Performance requirements met."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Edge cases comprehensively tested: empty queries, date validation, filter combinations, state preservation. Bug fixes applied (setClientFilter preserves state, searchUtils HTML escaping)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, proper TypeScript usage, comprehensive comments, good separation of concerns. Test coverage enables confident refactoring."
