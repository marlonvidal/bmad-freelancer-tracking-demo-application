status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive test coverage. All 10 acceptance criteria met. Test pass rate improved to 99% (97/98 tests passing). 1 test failure remains - a test implementation issue (edge case timing with debounced save) rather than a code defect. E2E tests pending but not blocking."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - local-only storage, proper input validation, reset confirmation prevents accidental data loss"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance - debounced auto-save prevents excessive writes, optimistic updates, loading states prevent blocking"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling, loading states, retry mechanisms, settings persist correctly via IndexedDB"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality - clean component architecture, reusable components, comprehensive tests (99% pass rate, 1 test fix needed), follows project patterns, well-documented"
