# Story 3.3: Billable/Non-Billable Task Toggle

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to mark tasks as billable or non-billable,
**so that** I can distinguish work that generates revenue from administrative tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Task card displays billable indicator (icon/badge) when task is marked billable
2. Task creation/edit provides toggle/checkbox to mark task as billable or non-billable
3. Billable toggle is easily accessible (one-click action)
4. Billable status is saved to IndexedDB with task data
5. Visual distinction between billable and non-billable tasks is clear (color coding or icon)
6. Billable status can be changed after task creation
7. Default billable status can be configured (per client/project or global default)
8. Billable indicator is visible on task card without requiring expansion
9. Billable status is included in task filtering/search (future enhancement consideration)
10. Billable toggle is accessible via keyboard navigation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.1 (Client Management) and 3.2 (Project Management), key learnings:
- Context-based state management simplifies component integration
- Optimistic updates improve perceived performance
- Inline editing patterns work well for quick actions
- Visual indicators (badges, icons) improve UX when used consistently
- Settings management via Context API provides global state access

**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.1 and 3.2 provide Client and Project models (for future per-client/project defaults)
- Task model already includes `isBillable: boolean` field
- Settings model already includes `defaultBillableStatus: boolean` field

### Data Models

**Task Model (relevant fields):**
```typescript
interface Task {
  // ... other fields
  isBillable: boolean;            // Whether task is billable (default: false)
  // ... other fields
}
```
[Source: architecture/common/data-models.md#task]

**Settings Model:**
```typescript
interface Settings {
  id: 'default';
  darkMode: boolean;
  defaultBillableStatus: boolean;  // Default billable status for new tasks
  defaultHourlyRate: number | null;
  keyboardShortcuts: Record<string, string>;
  onboardingCompleted: boolean;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```
[Source: architecture/common/data-models.md#settings]

**Future Enhancement (deferred):**
- Client model may have `defaultBillableStatus: boolean` in future
- Project model may have `defaultBillableStatus: boolean` in future
- Default hierarchy: Task > Project > Client > Global (for future implementation)

**Database Schema:**
- Tasks table: `isBillable` is stored as boolean in task record
- Settings table: Single record with `id: 'default'` stores `defaultBillableStatus`
[Source: architecture/common/database-schema.md#dexiejs-schema-definition]

### API Specifications

**TaskRepository Methods:**
- `update(id: string, updates: Partial<Task>): Promise<Task>` - Can update isBillable field
- All CRUD operations already support isBillable field

**SettingsRepository Methods (new):**
- `getSettings(): Promise<Settings>` - Get settings or create defaults if not exist
- `updateSettings(updates: Partial<Settings>): Promise<Settings>` - Update settings

**SettingsContext Methods (new):**
- `getDefaultBillableStatus(): boolean` - Get default billable status from settings
- `updateSettings(updates: Partial<Settings>): Promise<void>` - Update settings

[Source: architecture/components.md#data-access-layer]

### Component Specifications

**BillableIndicator Component:**
- Location: `src/components/task/BillableIndicator.tsx`
- Props: `isBillable: boolean`
- Behavior:
  - Renders icon/badge when isBillable is true
  - Does not render when isBillable is false
  - Visual: Dollar sign icon ($) or green badge with "Billable" text
  - Small, unobtrusive but visible
  - Accessible (ARIA labels)
- Styling: Similar to PriorityBadge pattern (small badge with icon)

**TaskCard Updates:**
- Add BillableIndicator component when task.isBillable is true
- Add clickable toggle for quick billable status change
- Position indicator appropriately (top-right or next to title)
- Ensure keyboard accessibility

**TaskForm Updates:**
- Add checkbox/toggle for isBillable
- Use SettingsContext to get default value for new tasks
- Pre-populate from task.isBillable when editing
- Include in form submission

[Source: architecture/common/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

### File Locations

Based on project structure:
- Components: `src/components/task/BillableIndicator.tsx` (new)
- Context: `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` (new)
- Repository: `src/services/data/repositories/SettingsRepository.ts` (new)
- Types: `src/types/settings.ts` (may need to be created if not exists)
- Tests: `tests/unit/components/task/`, `tests/unit/contexts/`, `tests/integration/`

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
- Component tests: BillableIndicator, TaskForm updates, TaskCard updates (React Testing Library)
- Context tests: SettingsContext (mock IndexedDB)
- Repository tests: SettingsRepository (mock Dexie)
- Target: 80%+ code coverage

**Integration Tests:**
- Complete billable toggle workflow
- Create task with billable toggle → verify indicator → toggle from card → verify update
- Default billable status application
- Keyboard navigation

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/components/task/`, `tests/unit/contexts/`, `tests/unit/services/data/repositories/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/billable-toggle.test.tsx`

[Source: architecture/common/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:**
- Use TypeScript with strict types (no `any`)
- One component per file
- Use Context API for state management (avoid prop drilling)
- Always use repository pattern (never access IndexedDB directly from components)
- All async operations must have try/catch error handling
- Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback appropriately for performance
- All interactive elements must have ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

**Error Handling:**
- Catch QuotaExceededError and provide user-friendly message
- Handle "not found" errors gracefully
- Show loading states during async operations
- Provide user feedback on success/error (toast notification or inline message)
- Optimistic updates with rollback on error

**Performance:**
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Use React.memo on BillableIndicator if needed
- Settings are loaded once on app initialization (singleton)
- TaskCard toggle should update immediately (optimistic update)

**Accessibility:**
- All toggles must be keyboard accessible (Tab, Space, Enter)
- ARIA labels must be descriptive
- Visual indicators must have text alternatives
- Focus management for toggle interactions

### Project Structure Notes

The project structure already includes:
- `src/types/task.ts` - Task type with isBillable field
- `src/components/kanban/TaskCard.tsx` - TaskCard component (needs updates)
- `src/components/task/TaskForm.tsx` - TaskForm component (needs updates)
- Database schema includes settings table

New components need to be created:
- `src/components/task/BillableIndicator.tsx` (new)
- `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` (new)
- `src/services/data/repositories/SettingsRepository.ts` (new)
- `src/types/settings.ts` (may need to be created if not exists)

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Additional Considerations

**Visual Design:**
- Billable indicator should be visually distinct but not overwhelming
- Consider using green color for billable (positive/revenue indicator)
- Icon options: Dollar sign ($), checkmark, or badge with "Billable" text
- Ensure indicator works in both light and dark modes
- Size should be similar to PriorityBadge for consistency

**Quick Toggle UX:**
- Toggle from TaskCard should be instant (no confirmation dialog)
- Visual feedback on toggle (brief highlight or animation)
- Loading state during update (optimistic update)
- Error handling with user-friendly message

**Default Billable Status:**
- For MVP: Only global default via Settings
- Per-client/project defaults are future enhancement (documented but not implemented)
- Default hierarchy documented for future: Task > Project > Client > Global
- Settings UI for configuring default can be added in future story

**Future Enhancements (AC 9):**
- Billable status filtering/search is explicitly marked as future enhancement
- No implementation needed for this story
- Document that filtering by billable status will be added in future

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Toggle in TaskForm: Standard checkbox keyboard behavior (Tab to focus, Space to toggle)
- Toggle on TaskCard: Must be focusable, Space/Enter to activate
- Ensure focus indicators are visible
- Tab order should be logical

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test File Location:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/components/task/`, `tests/unit/contexts/`, `tests/unit/services/data/repositories/`

**Test Patterns:**
- Use `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent` from React Testing Library
- Mock Context providers when testing components
- Mock IndexedDB operations when testing repositories
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- Test billable indicator visibility (shows when true, hidden when false)
- Test toggle functionality in TaskForm (checkbox/toggle)
- Test quick toggle on TaskCard (click to toggle)
- Test default billable status from settings
- Test isBillable persistence in IndexedDB
